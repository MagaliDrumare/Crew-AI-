# Crew-AI-
Crew typically refers to a group of AI agents that collaborate or work together to perform tasks, solve problems, or achieve a shared goal. These agents often work as a team, each with its own specialized functions or roles, and combine their efforts to complete complex tasks more efficiently than a single agent might be able to.
