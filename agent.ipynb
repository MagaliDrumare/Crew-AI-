Jane Doe is assigned to critical development tasks, which leverage her software engineering skills effectively, ensuring that the website's core functionality aligns with the design developed by Bob. The QA process is shared between Alice and Tom to evenly distribute the workload while ensuring comprehensive testing. John Doe, as Project Manager, oversees the final review and launch, coordinating between developers and designers to ensure smooth completion. Each allocation respects the current workload and skills of each member, maximizing efficiency and minimizing the risk of burnout or overburdening any single individual.\u001b[00m\n",
